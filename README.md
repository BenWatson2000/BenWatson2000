ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Ben and I'm a computer science graduate student with interests in cyber security and data science. I love to work on various projects and explore new technologies. Currently, I'm building my skills in web development and exploring ways to combine my interests in cyber security and data science with web development.

ðŸ”­ In my free time, I enjoy building small projects and experimenting with different technologies. I also like to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers.
